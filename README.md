# José Silva

Mobile developer, with 9+ years of Android and nearly a year with iOS, previous experience in Web.

I’m someone who’s driven by the curiosity in creating solutions to cover necessities. I love beautiful UIs, and projects that care for UX. Apart from my current job, I'm also a member of the Toptal network.

Regarding hobbies, I love music and I play electric bass with My Trulies (you can also find us Spotify and Youtube)), but also try to find time to some pet projects.
